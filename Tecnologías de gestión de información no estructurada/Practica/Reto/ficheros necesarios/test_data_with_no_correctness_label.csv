Kovacs, M.D., president of the ACC, said in a statement.“These recommendations will be adjusted as needed to correspond with the latest research.”Statement Abstract/Full TextLast Updated: Mar 20, 2020Copyright © 2020 HealthDay."

Lavie, MD, of the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute, Ochsner Clinical School – University of Queensland School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA, says, “Angiotensin II is known to foster inflammation, oxygenation, vasoconstriction, and fibrosis, so it is quite conceivable that a pharmaceutical agent that can inhibit the production of this hormone could actually be very beneficial for preventing lung injury and also for systemic health."

Nelson(Reuters) - Scientists are baffled by how the coronavirus attacks the body - killing many patients while barely affecting others.But some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure.Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable – and what patients should do about it – have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs.Researchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart.They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it.Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.The drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions.In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci - the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert - cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus.Efforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies.“There are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,” said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore."

Ananthakrishnan Chennai 20 March 2020 02:27 IST Updated: 20 March 2020 02:28 IST Patients have been told not to discontinue their medication One of the concerns highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic is whether the use of several common hypertension treatment drugs — coming under the class of Angiotensin-Controlling Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) — raises risks for patients who contract the novel coronavirus.The issue gained importance in social media and elsewhere, as some reports from severely affected countries such as Italy indicated a poor outcome for COVID-19 patients who have been taking these drugs for an underlying condition.Also read: Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in IndiaAdvertising AdvertisingThe top United States immunologist handling the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interaction with the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday that based on extrapolation of available knowledge, putting a patient on an ACE inhibitor could result in an increase in the expression of the enzyme, which is to say, the person taking the drug for hypertension may be, without knowing it, increasing the reception for the virus itself.Entry pointThat is because Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 (ACE2) receptors have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for SARS-CoV-2, according to medical literature.But, Dr. Fauci said, that was an extrapolation, and not based on data.“It is a possibility that we need to address,” he said, calling for studies in the wake of media reports from Italy that said 99% of people who died had an underlying condition, and in 75% of these cases, that condition was hypertension.Also read: Coronavirus | The importance of ‘contact tracing’Given the high medical care standards in Italy, he reasoned, if hypertension was an underlying condition, it was bound to have been treated and patients maintained well.Also, if the data appeared skewed towards the condition in spite of this, the cause would have to be investigated, he said.On the same issue, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), citing initial data from China, issued a position statement on March 13.It said a concern had arisen because it was observed that just as in the case of the coronavirus causing SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], “the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.” Watch | Soap or sanitiser?Which works better?"

Nelson(Reuters) – Scientists are baffled by how the coronavirus attacks the body – killing many patients while barely affecting others.But some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure.Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable – and what patients should do about it – have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs.Researchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart.They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it.Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.The drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions.In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci – the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert – cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus.Efforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies.“There are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,” said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore."

Ananthakrishnan Chennai , March 20, 2020 02:27 IST Updated: March 20, 2020 02:28 IST Patients have been told not to discontinue their medication One of the concerns highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic is whether the use of several common hypertension treatment drugs — coming under the class of Angiotensin-Controlling Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) — raises risks for patients who contract the novel coronavirus.The issue gained importance in social media and elsewhere, as some reports from severely affected countries such as Italy indicated a poor outcome for COVID-19 patients who have been taking these drugs for an underlying condition.Also read: Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in IndiaThe top United States immunologist handling the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interaction with the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday that based on extrapolation of available knowledge, putting a patient on an ACE inhibitor could result in an increase in the expression of the enzyme, which is to say, the person taking the drug for hypertension may be, without knowing it, increasing the reception for the virus itself.Entry pointThat is because Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 (ACE2) receptors have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for SARS-CoV-2, according to medical literature.But, Dr. Fauci said, that was an extrapolation, and not based on data.“It is a possibility that we need to address,” he said, calling for studies in the wake of media reports from Italy that said 99% of people who died had an underlying condition, and in 75% of these cases, that condition was hypertension.Also read: Coronavirus | The importance of ‘contact tracing’Given the high medical care standards in Italy, he reasoned, if hypertension was an underlying condition, it was bound to have been treated and patients maintained well."

Maddox, MD, MSc of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Franz H. Messerli, MD of the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland, and Mount Sinai Health Medical Center/Icahn School of Medicine in New York, noted that “hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent comorbidities in affected patients, and case fatality rates tended to be high in these individuals.”Moreover, patients with those comorbidities are likely to be treated with ACEI and ARBs.“Both ACE and ACE2 belong to the ACE family of dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidases and exert distinct physiological functions.ACE cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which in turn binds and activates angiotensin II receptor type 1.This activation leads to vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects,” they wrote.“In contrast, ACE2 also degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9."

despite more than half of the population regularly smoking cigarettes.When smokers do get diagnosed with the virus, however, they appear to be more likely to get so sick that they need ventilation, two studies in the review showed.Researchers admit that hospitals are probably not recording patients' smoking status properly, potentially because they are too busy, patients are too sick to answer, or because people lie in their answers.But they are struggling to knock down mounting evidence suggesting an apparent protective effect given by cigarettes, which one expert today admitted was 'weird'."

Suggests Smoking May Protect Against COVID-19 InfectionThe doctor referenced researchers at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, who concluded that only 1.4% of 140 COVID-19 patients were smokers.""We never imagined having these types of questions a few weeks ago,"" the doctor said - PHOTOPQR / L'EST REPUBLICAIN By Taha Mebtoul - Apr 8, 2020Rabat – President of the COVID-19 Scientific Council in France, Dr. Jean-Francois Delfraissy, claimed on April 8 that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in critical condition are non-smokers.In an interview with the France Info radio station, Delfraissy said that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in critical condition are non-smokers.The immunology doctor suggested the nicotine in tobacco may be a form of protection against the virus.“We never imagined having these types of questions a few weeks ago,” he said.The doctor warned the audience of the dangers associated with smoking and its undeniable damage to the human respiratory system.Even if cigarettes protect against COVID-19 contamination, smokers would be exposed to severe forms of the virus once infected, leading to a respiratory polypathology, Delfraissy explained.The doctor referenced researchers at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, who concluded that only 1.4% of 140 COVID-19 patients were smokers.In an February interview with the French news channel LCI, Dr. Sandrine Belouzard, a researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research in France, also offered evidence favoring smokers.She explained that a Chinese study on 1,000 COVID-19 patients revealed that more than 85% of them have never smoked, while only 12-13% have smoked before or are active smokers.Smokers account for 17% of COVID-19 patients in critical condition, according to the same study.“I don’t know if it’s statistically significant, but it means that people who have smoked are more likely to develop a severe form of COVID-19,” said Belouzard, adding that smokers tend to have chronic bronchitis and other respiratory diseases.Read also: French Journalist Makes Racist Joke Over Chinese Mourners Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin WhatsApp Pinterest Taha

articleShareTweetSharesendShareTweetSharesendMoreHideShareSendShareShareShareSendShareShareText size Aa Aa France severely curtailed the sale of nicotine products on Friday after a study suggested smokers may be less likely to contract COVID-19.The decree, issued by the Ministry of Health, limits pharmacies from selling more than a one-month supply of any nicotine products aimed at curbing dependence to cigarettes.Each sale is to be logged by pharmacies whether the buyer had a doctor's prescription or not.Online sale has meanwhile been completely banned.The measures were taken to ""prevent the health risk linked to the excessive consumption or misuse"" of nicotine products by people hoping to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus and ""to guarantee the continuous supply for people requiring medication to stop smoking,"" the decree states.It comes just days after a study by the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris flagged ""that current smoking status appears to be a protective factor against the infection by SARS-CoV-2"".Coronavirus: WHO warns against 'immunity passports' for recovered patientsIt noted that ""compared to the French general population, the Covid-19 population exhibited a significantly weaker current daily smoker rate by 80.3 % for outpatients and by 75.4 % for inpatients"" and theorised that ""nicotine may be suggested as a potential preventive agent against Covid-19 infection.""The hospital now plans to trial the use of nicotine patches or other products on hospitalised COVID-19 patients and in the general population to test its efficiency against the virus.""One should not forget that nicotine is a drug of abuse responsible for smoking addiction.Smoking has severe pathological consequences and remains a serious danger for health,"" it warned.France has suffered greatly from the pandemic with 22,245 deaths recorded in hospitals and care homes since the beginning of the outbreak — the fourth highest tally in the world as of April 24.Last month, the country's health authorities called on doctors to not prescribe hydroxychloroquine for suspected cases of COVID-19 after a study suggested it could be a potential treatment

cytokine storm in infected patients resulting in severe lung damage and deathLenzilumab is in clinical studies for prevention of cytokine storm BURLINGAME, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2020 / Humanigen, Inc., (OTCQB:HGEN) (""Humanigen""), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing its portfolio of clinical and preclinical therapies for the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases, announced today that it is actively exploring clinical stage strategies and partnerships to evaluate whether lenzilumab, the company's proprietary Humaneered® anti-human-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, may reduce or prevent cytokine storm resulting from COVID-19 (or coronavirus, also referred to as SARS-CoV-2) infection.A recent pre-publication, titled ""Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus"", supports the hypothesis that cytokine storm-induced immune mechanism have contributed to patient mortality with the current pandemic strain of coronavirus.The severe clinical features associated with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses result from an inflammation-induced lung injury requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation.This lung injury is a result of cytokine storm resulting from a hyper-reactive immune response.The lung injury that leads to death is not directly related to the virus, but appears to be a result of a hyper-reactive immune response to the virus triggering a cytokine storm that can continue even after viral titers begin to fall.The authors of the study assessed samples from patients with severe pneumonia resulting from COVID-19 infection to identify whether inflammatory factors such as GM-CSF, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were implicated.The authors noted that steroid treatment in such cases has been disappointing in terms of outcome, but suggest that a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF may prevent or curb the hyper-active immune response caused by COVID-19 in this setting.Humanigen believes that the authors' findings are clearly worthy of further investigation, suggesting that to reduce or eradicate ICU care and prevent deaths from COVID-19 infection, an intervention may be needed to prevent cytokine storm.Lenzilumab has been shown to prevent cytokine storm in animal models and this work has been published in peer reviewed publications.Patients are soon expected to be enrolled in a clinical study to determine lenzilumab's effect on cytokine storm associated with the hyper-active immune response associated with CAR-T therapy in collaboration with Kite Pharma.Dr.Cameron Durrant, CEO of Humanigen, stated, ""These data confirm previously published data from the SARS and the MERS outbreaks, caused by strains of coronavirus different from the current COVID-19 strains, which indicated that severe pneumonia in SARS and MERS resulted from cytokine storm."

yet as pharmaceutical giants search for a treatment, we reveal the deadly risks that could cost the ultimate priceHere’s how to help people impacted by Covid-19By Guy Adams and John Naish for the Daily Mail Published: 20:10 EDT, 24 April 2020 | Updated: 20:10 EDT, 24 April 2020 e-mail View comments Modern science has scarcely presented a more crucial goal, offering untold riches and perhaps even a Nobel prize to the victor, as well as the chance to return the world to normal.Yet the search for a cure for coronavirus is also uniquely perilous thanks to the dangers inherent in rushing new medical products to market.Across the globe, thousands of researchers employed by governments, laboratories and drug firms are working flat-out to crack this all-important riddle.As are endless armchair experts, whose numbers now evidently include Donald Trump.Yesterday, the world’s most powerful man used a press conference to propose various highly unorthodox new treatments for coronavirus, including ‘injecting’ disinfectant into the body and blasting patients with ultraviolet light.Back in the real world, researchers are working tirelessly to combat the virus.But while bullish claims have been made for a host of possible treatments, the truth is that scientists have little idea which ones might end up being of use.‘Four months into the pandemic, we have had millions of people infected but no data yet to show that any particular treatment is especially effective,’ says Professor Babak Javid, the Principal Investigator at Tsinghua University school of medicine in Beijing, and a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals.Nonetheless, here are some of the most likely candidates:Trump’s malaria pillIn mid-March, the American President used Twitter to amplify reports that Covid-19 patients could be successfully treated via a combination of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and a common antibiotic, Azithromycin.In a later press conference, the President insisted that ‘common sense’ qualified him to make such a claim, urging Americans to ‘take it’ and asking them: ‘What have you got to lose?’Well, quite a lot, as it turned out.The drugs have a catalogue of nasty side-effects, including an increased risk of cardiac arrest, skin blistering, hearing loss and an ‘inability to move the eyes’.A study this week of 368 male coronavirus patients found that 28 per cent of those treated via hydroxychloroquine alone and 22 per cent who received both drugs (the malaria treatment and azithromycin) in U.S. hospitals died."

(Nexstar Media Wire) – A Virginia poison control center is reminding residents that they should never drink bleach – and that doing so will certainly not prevent coronavirus.The Blue Ridge Poison Center said in a letter obtained by WCAV, “There is a lot of confusing, incomplete, and just plain inaccurate information circulating about how to prevent the COVID-19 virus (“coronavirus”) from spreading.Some advice measures simply won’t help, and some could be downright dangerous.The Blue Ridge Poison Center at UVA Health warns that drinking bleach will not prevent COVID-19 infections and could cause serious injury.” While bleach is an effective tool for disinfecting car handles, desktops and other surfaces, the BRPC warns that the cleaning agent can burn one’s mouth, throat and stomach."
